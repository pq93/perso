## Analysis of Algorithms
The theoretical study of computer-program **performance** resource usage
- What's more important than performance?
Correctness, simplicity, maintainability, cost (programmer time, etc.), stability (robustness of software), functionality, modularity, scalability, user-friendliness, security...
- Why study algorithms and performance?
    - Performance measures the line between the feasible and the infeasible.
    - Algorithms can describe program behavior (a clean way of thinking about things, the universal thing that we quantify).
    - Tons of fun.
